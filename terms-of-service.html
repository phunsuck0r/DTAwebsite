Quotations are based on the information provided to us at the time of enquiry and may be subject to change if the scope of work differs from what was described.</p>
        <p>A quotation does not constitute a binding contract. A contract is formed only when we confirm acceptance of your order in writing or when we commence the agreed works.</p>

        <h2>5. Our Services</h2>
        <h3>5.1 Standard of Work</h3>
        <p>We undertake to carry out all work with reasonable skill and care, in accordance with applicable British Standards, IET Wiring Regulations (BS 7671), and all relevant legislation and industry codes of practice.</p>

        <h3>5.3 Timescales</h3>
        <p>We will endeavour to complete all works within the agreed timescales. However, completion dates are estimates and may be affected by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to access restrictions, supply chain delays, weather conditions, and the discovery of unforeseen issues during the course of works.</p>

        <h2>6. Payment Terms</h2>

            <li>Payment terms will be specified in the quotation or contract for each project</li>
            <li>For larger projects, staged payments may be required as agreed in writing</li>
            <li>Invoices are payable within 30 days of the invoice date, unless otherwise agreed</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to charge interest on overdue payments in accordance with the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998</li>
            <li>VAT will be charged at the applicable rate where we are VAT registered</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Cancellation</h2>
        <p>If you wish to cancel agreed works, you must notify us in writing as soon as possible. Where we have already incurred costs, including the purchase of materials or allocation of resources, you may be liable for those costs. Cancellation charges will be communicated to you clearly and promptly.</p>

        <h2>8. Warranties and Guarantees</h2>
        <p>We provide warranties on our workmanship as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All electrical and mechanical installation work is guaranteed for a minimum of 12 months from the date of completion</li>

            <li>Warranty claims must be reported in writing within a reasonable period of discovering the defect</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These warranties do not cover defects caused by misuse, unauthorised modification, fair wear and tear, or failure to follow maintenance recommendations.</p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other matter for which it would be unlawful to exclude or limit liability.</p>
        <p>Subject to the above, our total liability to you in connection with any contract shall not exceed the total value of the contract. We shall not be liable for any indirect or consequential losses, including but not limited to loss of profit, loss of business, or loss of anticipated savings.</p>

        <h2>13. Disputes</h2>
